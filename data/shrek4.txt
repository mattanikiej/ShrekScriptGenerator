[The story starts as the first two films started, with a book lying on the
ground. Only this book had a particular title on it.]
"Shrek Forever After"
[It was opened up to a page of Far Far Away with King Harold and Queen
Lillian holding their newborn as a man was heard narrating.]
Man's Voice:
had a beautiful daughter named Fiona.
The pages flipped to one page of older Fiona's human form during the day,
and her ogre form during the night.
Man's Voice:
lovely princess; by night, a hideous ogre.
The pages then turned to the pages with a knight kneeling, holding a
bouquet of flowers and Fiona waiting in the tower guarded by a certain
dragon's tail.
Man's Voice:
waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love
would arrive.
The next pages showed Harold and Lillian in a carriage, racing away from
their safe kingdom and into the dark, foreboding forest.
Man's Voice:
were forced to resort to more desperate measures.
(Flashback)
Years ago, before Harold and Lillian had reunited with their daughter, the
horses pulling the carriage that carried the king and queen raced through
the forest like mad.
Inside the carriage, the king and queen held each others' hands in worry.
The carriage then arrived towards an even more eerie part of the forest. It
was Crone's Nest Carriage Park, a medieval trailer park. The signs
underneath the main said "No Vacancy" and "Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter
Here". Two witches guarding recognized the royal carriage and opened the
gates, allowing the carriage inside. The carriage slowed down and was
pulled more cautiously, and as that happened, the king and queen looked at
all the witches inhabiting the area near their broken down carriages.
One witch sneered, while stroking a black cat she held, and many other
black cats, that she hoarded, all snarled. King Harold yelped a bit. Then
he and Lillian saw another witch dumping out trash from the window of her
carriage, while one witch standing by, smirking, as she made a kissy noise
to the king.
King Harold:

Page 2/82

Then he and Lillian saw a family of hillbilly-type witches, playing
mandolins, spitting tobacco, holding a bottle of moonshine and giving
dirty, foul looks at the visitors, while a bare-butted baby witch was
crawling on the ground. The royal couple were deeply unsettled as Lillian
locked the carriage door.
Driver:
The horses stopped at a huge egg-like carriage with an "R" on top.
King Harold:
only true love’s kiss could break Fiona’s curse.
Queen Lillian:
last hope. Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.
King Harold:
this...person? He’s devious. He’s deceitful. He’s...he’s...
A bit later, the king and queen were inside the carriage as the owner spun
around in his chair, revealing himself. He was Rumpelstiltskin.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Lightning flashed at the mention of his name. His pet goose, Fifi, honked a
bit. The little man kissed the uneasy Lillian's hand in respect.
Rumpelstiltskin:
She chuckled nervously a bit, pulling her hand away.
Queen Lillian:
Fifi then hissed at Harold, startling him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The goose did as her master said and went off to the side. Then the deal
maker rolled out a contract he had for the royal couple to sign.
Rumpelstiltskin:
King Harold:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Away (gives a menacing look) over to me.
Lightning flashed again, and King Harold gasped at what the short man said.
Lightning flashed even when it showed Fifi. The royal couple turned as
Harold spoke quietly to his wife, while Rumpelstiltskin just listened in,
giving a fiendish smirk.

Page 3/82

King Harold:
Queen Lillian:
that tower far too long.
Rumpelstiltskin:
King Harold:
Rumpelstiltskin:
more to you than your daughter...
The king angrily stopped the paper.
King Harold:
Rumpelstiltskin:
So Rumpelstiltskin slammed the windows shut and got out a drawer of jars of
magic ink, slammed one jar down and clapped his hands.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The goose jumped in his arms and he yanked a feather out of her behind,
making the king cringe in disgust. He then dipped the feather's end into
the magic ink, with a small magic cloud appearing as Harold took the
feather from him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Lightning flashed for dramatic effect once more, as he slid the contract
towards them. Harold was about to sign it, while Rumpelstiltskin eagerly
and anxiously waited. The king hesitated a bit as he looked at his wife,
who nodded seriously. So Harold proceeded to sign it, but before he could,
the carriage's door was burst open and the royal messenger was there, out
of breath.
Messenger:
Harold and Lillian gasped happily, while Rumpelstiltskin was shocked.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The king turned, giving a smirk as he ripped the contract up, to the deal
maker's dismay.
Rumpelstiltskin:
(End of Flashback)
In the present, the book was finsihed being read by the certain foiled deal

maker, who was the one narrating. The next pages showed Shrek roaring,
scaring away villagers, and then the helmeted Shrek carrying Fiona over his
back while he and Donkey ran away from Dragon and the fire she breathed.
Donkey's tail was even on fire.
Rumpelstiltskin:
whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful
Princess Fiona.
He angrily turned the page, showing a picture of Shrek and Fiona (as an
ogre) kissing and a separate picture of their babies.
Rumpelstiltskin:
babies!
He ripped off the page of the babies, showing the page of good guys and
villains (who were reformed thanks to Artie) holding hands together.
Rumpelstiltskin:
(sarcastically) Goody for them!
He ripped off that page as well, leaving the page with the ogre family in
front of the swamp.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He ripped off that page, leaving the page of Shrek with Donkey and Puss
bumping fists.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He ripped off that page, getting to the final one with Shrek and Fiona
riding a unicorn, while Pinocchio waved a wand, Donkey ran with his kids,
the Three Little Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, Puss and Gingy riding down
rainbows, and the ogre babies riding a cloud.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He ripped out that as well, and fumed while clenching the page in fist. He
was shown to be reading the book in a library. Then, Pinocchio, wearing an
apron, appeared and saw what he was doing.
Pinocchio:
He quickly realized he ripped a book that didn't belong to him, as he
turned to the wooden puppet.
Rumpelstiltskin:
little boy?
Pinocchio:

Page 5/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
The next thing you know, Rumpelstiltskin was booted out of the library by
Pinocchio, screaming as he face-planted into the dirty sidewalk.
Pinocchio:
He shut the door as the coughing former deal maker looked at the final page
of the book and picked it up, looking at it with anger.
Rumpelstiltskin:
In the certain swamp home of our ogre hero, another day was beginning as we
see the same "Beware of Ogres" sign, now with the pictures of the ogre baby
triplets added, and a swing set and small slide were added in the yard.
Inside the home, Shrek and Fiona were asleep in their bed until awakened by
a squeaking noise. They looked and saw their babies at the foot of the bed,
with Felicia squeaking a squeaky toy.
Felicia:
Fiona:
Shrek:
The ogres kissed.
After getting up and dressed, Shrek was in his arm-chair with his kids,
each drinking swamp juice from their own sippy cup, and each gave a small
belch.
Fiona:
Shrek:
A bit later, Shrek brought Fergus over to the changing table.
Shrek:
front of face) Big, grownup ogre stink!
Some time after changing Fergus, Shrek went outside with the full rotten
diaper, heading to the diaper pale.
Shrek:
He dumped it in, and then he took a newspaper, heading to the outhouse. At
this time, a bus-sized chariot known as the "Star Tours Chariot" appeared,
with a tour guide and tourists here to see the famous ogre.
Tour Guide:
that showed us you don’t have to change your undies to change the world!

Page 6/82

The ogre gave an annoyed look before closing the door to the outhouse.
Tour Guide:
there.
Next, Shrek was trying to fit a little shoe onto Farkle's foot, with Farkle
moving his little legs around, and was having trouble trying to put it on.
Shrek:
Fiona then showed up and thought she would help. So she placed it on her
son's foot.
Fiona:
through the loop, and finally, into the castle.
The parents then blew on their baby's cheeks. A bit later, Shrek thought
he'd have some time to himself so he sat in his armchair with a glass of
eyeball-tini in his hand, and just when he was about to sip it, a certain
donkey popped his head through the window.
Donkey:
The startled ogre yelped as he fell back. Then Donkey and his kids came in
to spend time with Shrek and his family.
Donkey:
do is call!
That night, at dinner, Puss flipped in the air and landed on the dinner
table, finishing a story being told to the kids.
Puss:
ogre and they lived...
Donkey:
Fiona:
Shrek:
The kids all jumped and cheered. After the guests left and the triplets
were put to sleep, Shrek took some dishes from the table and headed to
where Fiona was washing some dishes at the sink next to the window. Fiona
then saw a star whizzing by.
Fiona:
She closed her eyes, scrunched up her nose and crossed her fingers.
Shrek:

Page 7/82

Fiona:
Shrek:
The two then embraced and kissed, while Puss sat on the side of the window,
playing a guitar as he sang a tender song.
Puss:
alright
The next morning, Shrek was awakened the same way he was yesterday: by the
squeaking of his kids' squeaky toy.
Felicia:
Fiona:
So, the events from yesterday began to happen again, starting with Shrek
burping his babies. The boys belched, but Felicia broke wind.
Fiona:
Next, it was changing time.
Shrek:
Before he could finish, a fountain of fluid sprayed at his face and even
got into his mouth, but thankfully, it was coming from a goldfish Fergus
squirted water from as he giggled.
Shrek:
He took the fish and dropped it back in the goldfish bowl. Then, after
taking the diaper to the pail outside, he went to the outhouse with the
tourist chariot arriving again, to his annoyance.
Tour Guide:
have to change your undies to change the world!
He slammed the door. Later, he hoped to have some alone time and drink his
eyeball-tini in his armchair, but Donkey showed up again.
Donkey:
He and his kids barged in, and as he sang, the dronkeys flew around,
chasing the giggling ogre babies.
Then, Shrek decided to relax in the mud pit outside, but suddenly Fiona
came outside.
Fiona:
Shrek's eyes widened.

Page 8/82

That night, the story that was told at dinner the previous night was told
again.
Puss:
Donkey:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Then the routine happened again with Shrek being woken up by his babies and
the squeaky toy, and this time, the triplets were in the bed between the
parents, with Farkle pounding Shrek, who looked like he barely got any
sleep.
Felicia:
Fergus:
Next, it was time for burping. All three burped, one by one, but then broke
wind simultaneously.
Fiona:
After Shrek tossed the diaper away, the tourists visited yet again.
Tour Guide:
Shrek slammed the door of the outhouse. Then Donkey barged in through the
door with his kids flapping in.
Donkey:
Shrek:
The Dronkeys floated while carrying the babies, with some fussing. Then, as
Shrek, with a towel around himself, tried to get to the mud pit for some
relaxation, Fiona called out again.
Fiona:
He winced. Then, another day, we see Shrek trying to fit the shoe onto
Farkle.
Shrek:
His son then kicked him in the chin. Next, we see instances of the babies
drinking and belching, and of Shrek throwing a diaper away in the pale in
the Winter, on a rainy day, and in the Spring. One day, the tourist chariot
returned, knocking the outhouse over while Shrek was on the john.

Page 9/82

Tour Guide:
When it was playdate time, Shrek just stood frozen in the middle of the
chaos that was the Dronkeys and ogres rough-housing, and one of the
Dronkeys breathing fire. Then, he tried for the pit again, but didn't make
it very far when Fiona's voice called out.
Fiona's Voice:
He walked back in annoyance. We then see the babies bouncing in bed with
Felicia hitting her dad softly with her toy, but Shrek was lying on the
floor and did not make any motion.
Felicia:
Finally, it was the dinner/story portion of the seemingly repetitive cycle.
Puss:
Donkey:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Later, everyone was asleep, all except for Shrek, who was awake by all the
same routine everyday. He rubbed his face with his hands, sighing a bit. He
looked at Fiona, sound asleep, before getting up and walking to a dresser.
There, he opened up a drawer with a folded up piece of paper inside. He
unfolded it, revealing it to be an old Wanted poster of him back from
before he met Donkey, rescued Fiona and all his other adventures happened.
He looked glum, not feeling as if he was a real ogre anymore. He hung the
poster up on the corner of the mirror, and then he looked at the mirror,
trying to see if he had any of it inside him.
Shrek:
It was no use though, he didn't even scare himself. He hanged his head,
feeling his days as an ogre were truly gone. The next day, he looked uneasy
as he, his family and Donkey were riding Dragon, with Puss at the edge,
playing "King of the World", and the Dronkeys were flying at her side, as
the song "Isn't It Strange" by Scissor Sisters played. Shrek was carrying a
back case full of baby supplies on his back. The babies whooped and laughed
with excitement as Dragon soared through the clouds. The wind then pushed
Puss back towards Donkey, and Felicia pulled on one Dronkey's tail, making
her unintentionally shoot out flames at her brother's tail. He yelped and
glared at his sister, thinking it was on purpose, before chasing her. He
breathed fire at her, almost hitting her and barely blackening Shrek's

Page 10/82

snout.
The group then arrived in Far Far Away, passing the kingdom's
Hollywood-like sign, and came down for a landing near the Candy Apple
(formerly known as the Poison Apple until the villains reformed), and
everyone was unloading their baggage and getting off the dragon.
Donkey:
He and his wife kiss.
Donkey:
Fiona then placed each of her babies on a Dronkey, and they were flown
around for fun. As Puss carried a whole stack of presents for the triplets,
since it was their birthday, Shrek was carrying down a fold-out
three-in-one stroller.
Puss:
He set the three-in-one stroller down and tried unfolding them in
frustration, but was having trouble. Then, to his further annoyance, some
villagers ran over to him with pitchforks and torches, but not the way
people used to. In fact, they were grinning.
Villagers:
Villager 1:
sign our pitchforks?
Villager 2:
Shrek quickly dodged the torch as it nearly touched him.
Villager 3:
Villager 2:
Shrek:
He did not like what that villager was implying.
A bit later, inside, Pinocchio was dancing on a stage in front of four
animatronics.
Pinocchio:
year older, not a pain Friends still remain the same, refrain. Super duper,
party pooper! Birthday, birthday, birthday bash! Birthday, birthday,
birthday bash!
Then everyone else inside, minus Shrek, who was holding Felicia and Fergus,
sang along.

Page 11/82

(Crowd):
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!
All those who sang laughed and cheered, and Farkle imitated Pinocchio's
dancing a bit. Donkey noticed Shrek not singing, laughing or cheering.
Donkey:
Shrek (Annoyed) No, thanks.
Donkey:
friend.
Shrek:
everything I don’t want to do?
As he talked, Felicia squeaked her toy right in her father's ear.
Shrek:
Felicia, not in daddy's ear.
Then a father tapped Shrek on the shoulder.
Butterpants's Father: Excuse me, Mr. Shrek? Could you do that ogre roar of
yours for my son? He’s a big, big fan.
Next to him stood his son, a chubby little boy with a grumpy-looking
straight face and lollipop in his fist.
Butterpants:
Shrek:
Butter Pants:
Shrek then starts to frown his smile while looking at Butterpants. Fiona
then came by and took Fergus off Shrek to hold him for a little bit.
Fiona:
Why don't you go check on the cake?
Shrek:
He went to go check on the birthday cake.
Fiona:
Shrek sighs deeply. At the kitchen area, the Muffin Man was finishing
putting some decoration on Gingy's legs.
Muffin Man:
Once Gingy was done, he stood up with his legs frosted, appearing to look

Page 12/82

like chaps and he even wore a cowboy hat made of frosting to boot.
Gingy:
(prances around) Yee-haw! Giddy up!
Shrek then arrived at the counter.
Muffin Man:
Gingy:
The baker then got out a tray holding a frosted cake, decorated with a
cutesy grinning ogre head with candy corn for teeth.
Muffin Man:
Shrek was appalled by the cake.
Shrek:
Gingy:
Doris, wearing party service clothes, and picking up some plates, spoke.
Doris:
Donkey:
Shrek, still feeling bitter, started carrying the cake away.
Shrek:
Donkey:
So he licked the cake.
Shrek:
Then Butterpants and his father appeared next to him again.
Butterpants's Father: As long as you’re not doing anything, how about one
of those famous Shrek roars?
Butterpants:
Shrek:
he’s angry. (chuckles a bit) You don’t want to see me angry, do you?
Butterpants:
He licked his lollipop, while Shrek just walked away, trying to keep his
anger in.

Page 13/82

Shrek:
Butterpants:
He set the cake down at the table Fiona was at.
Fiona:
She then saw the cake with a big smear over it, thanks to Donkey's licking.
Fiona:
Shrek:
Queen Lillian:
Shrek:
Queen Lillian:
eat like one.
Mabel, wearing service clothes as well, walked by.
Mabel:
Wolf walked by blowing up a balloon until it popped, startling Shrek.
Fiona:
Fiona went to get the candles.
Shrek:
He turned and to his alarm, he saw that the cake was gone, and there was
nothing left but a couple crumbs.
Shrek:
The pigs stood there with frosting on their lips, looking guilty.
Heimlich:
Dieter:
Shrek:
Then his babies started crying a bit, probably because they heard that the
pigs ate the cake.
Shrek:
Butterpants's Father: Hey! I believe you promised my son a roar.

Page 14/82

Butterpants:
Shrek:
Butterpants:
Shrek:
Heimlich:
The babies cried some more, and Shrek tried calming them down by bouncing
them.
Butterpants's Father: Come on man, One roar.
Donkey:
The Dronkeys gathered around their dad, excited for uncle Shrek's roar.
Shrek:
Dieter:
Heimlich:
Horst:
Dieter:
Horst:
The babies cried some more.
Shrek:
Fiona came and took her kids, holding them.
Fiona:
Next, Butterpants was hugging Donkey.
Donkey:
Butterpants:
Pinocchio ran around Shrek, singing and shouting indistinctly. Wolf blew
another balloon up until it popped. Then everyone all spoke or made noises
at once. All of this pressure and tension going on today was taking a toll
on Shrek enough, he was losing his patience, trying his best to fight it.
Crowd:

Page 15/82

Shrek couldn't hold it in any longer, so he let out an enormous, furious
ogre roar that nearly blew everyone away, even Butterpants's hat was blown
off.
Shrek:
RRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!!
Once he was done, he panted and everyone else was left stunned and silent
for a bit until they all cheered.
Butterpants:
Wolf then slapped a party hat onto Shrek's head, to his annoyance.
Puss:
He lifted his cape to reveal another cake decorated like the last one.
Puss:
Everyone, minus Fiona, started chanting Shrek's name as Shrek stared
angrily at the cake, fuming.
Most of everyone: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
The concerned Fiona just noticed the look on her husband as he handed
Felicia to her mother.
Fiona:
Shrek continued glaring at the adorable ogre picture on the cake, feeling
it mocked him.
Most of everyone: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Shrek then slammed his big fist into the cake's center, making everyone
gasp in shock. He all gave a miserable stare at everybody and even Fiona,
who was more stunned than anyone else. Then he stormed out of the diner in
anger. Everyone else just stood, stunned. Even Gingy was stunned as his
frosting chaps fell off.
Outside, a familiar washed-up deal maker was in the trash, looking for
scraps, as he saw a plate and licked it, trying to get some flavor. Then he
heard the door slam as he hid, but saw Shrek storm out, with Fiona
following.
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
you. Is this really how you want to remember the kids’ first birthday?
Shrek:

Page 16/82

Fiona:
party, at home.
Shrek:
Step right up! (does a mocking jolly dance) See the dancing ogre! Don’t
worry! He won’t bite!
He then took off the party hat, smashed it and threw it to the ground.
Shrek:
Fiona:
maybe that’s not such a bad thing.
Shrek:
real ogre. You spent half your life in a palace.
Fiona:
Shrek:
used to be! Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud
bath in peace. When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it! Back
when the world made sense!
Fiona:
Shrek:
She looked at him, apalled by the answer, and a long silence followed,
before Fiona spoke quietly, feeling hurt.
Fiona:
you, friends who adore you. You have everything. Why is it the only person
who can’t see that is you?
She then turned away and went to the door, looking back at her husband, who
only gave a bitter look before she went back inside. Shrek just stood there
before turning and walking away bitterly.
Shrek:
As he left, Rumpelstiltskin peeked out, and his pet goose, who was now
freakishly larger than she was before, peeked out of another trash can,
eating some trash. Rumpelstiltskin smirked evilly, knowing this was his
chance to finally get back at the ogre who put him out of business.
Later, as rain clouds were appearing, Shrek was storming alone in the
forest, stewing about what Fiona said.

Page 17/82

Shrek:
got another thing coming. She’s not the boss of me. I’m an ogre and I’m not
gonna apologize for acting like one.
He then heard a voice from the distance.
Voice:
He headed over to see who it was, and in the middle of the forest, the
cries of help (or so Shrek believes) came from Rumpelstiltskin, whose legs
were underneath his carriage, making it appear as his carriage was broken
down on top of him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Someone, anyone! Help me! The pain!
Shrek rolled his eyes as he went over and used his strength to lift up the
carriage.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Grandma? Is that you?
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
He scooched back underneath in "fright".
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
The short man quickly crawled away from the carriage. Shrek then put the
carriage back down on the ground and fixed the wheel.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.
The former deal maker followed the ogre.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:

Page 18/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
way myself. But, seriously, let me give you a ride. I insist. Come on. It’s
the least I can do after all you’ve done for me.
The ogre sighed, rolling his eyes, but it seemed like he was giving in.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek glanced back at the carriage, with Fifi at the reigns, honking a bit.
After Rumpelstiltskin managed to lead the ogre to his carriage, the two
went inside with the short man throwing off his hat and going to his table
to prepare a drink, shaking it up in his bottle.
Rumpelstiltskin:
and tonic? A liquid libation to ease that frustration?
He even made a fresh certain drink containing an eyeball.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek peered into the carriage and at the drink, unsure, but he was giving
in again.
Shrek:
A couple hours later, rain was pouring as Fifi was pulling the carriage
through the forest. Inside, Shrek was telling a joke to Rumpelstiltskin,
and the ogre has had more than just one Eyeball-tini.
Shrek:
The two chuckled a bit.
Rumpelstiltskin:
an ogre...no worries, no responsibilities. (takes a sip of an eyeball-tini)
You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
again.
He ate the eyeball off the toothpick.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Magical transactions are my specialty! Come on!
He then grabbed all the empty glasses to put them away.

Page 19/82

Shrek:
The short man laughed sarcastically while climbing a ladder.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He started rummaging through his deal scrolls.
Rumpelstiltskin:
one) Ah.
He then laid out one special contract onto the table, titled "Ogre for a
Day".
Rumpelstiltskin:
The ogre was even more puzzled than ever. The short man then appeared right
next to him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
You’ll be, like, "Roar!" And the villagers will be, like, (mimicking scared
citizen) "Get away! It’s Shrek! I’m so scared of him!" It would be just
like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle. When the world
made sense.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
I mean, there’s something. A small thing. Nothing. A little thing.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
A little ding was heard.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He put on some oven mitts, opened the stove and took out the cooked rat.
Rumpelstiltskin:
something to get something. In this case, you gotta give a day to get a
day. That’s all.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
contract. No one will even know you’re gone, and by the time this day is

Page 20/82

up, (gives a smile) you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
doesn’t matter. Do you like white meat or dark meat?
The short man poured some sauce onto the rat with a soup ladel. Shrek
looked thoughtful about this deal.
Shrek:
As Rumpelstiltskin got out a knife and fork, he smirked secretly.
Rumpelstiltskin:
(starts carving the rat) A day you had the flu? A day you lost a pet?
Then he got angry, recalling the day Shrek put him out of business, as he
started carving faster.
Rumpelstiltskin:
nose where it didn’t belong destroying your business and ruining your
life?!
Of course, he was carving so fast that he ended up cutting through the rat
and the plate, breaking it. Shrek looked at him a bit strangely but
Rumpelstiltskin quickly realized his behavior as he hastily began to bring
back his composure.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He placed the plate with the lower half of the rat on the table.
Shrek:
I’d like to take back.
He laughed, and the short man forced a laugh.
Rumpelstiltskin:
What about a day you wouldn’t even remember? Like a day when you were a
baby.
He began to rock his arms back and forth like rocking a baby to sleep, but
figuratively.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek, who was half-way done eating his half of the rat, spoke.
Shrek:
care.
He chucked the rest of his half into his mouth, while Rumpelstiltskin

Page 21/82

glared.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He then got out the ink jar and feather pen, dabbed the said pen into said
jar, with a small magic spark appearing.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
myself.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek looked down at the contract for a moment, and then looked back up at
the deal maker, who handed the quill to the ogre.
Rumpelstiltskin:
As Shrek started signing his name in big, bold, gold letters, the deal
maker kept urging him to sign it. He was so tensed from this, that even his
nasty toes with yellow toenails ripped out of his shoes and scraped the
floor.
Rumpelstiltskin:
During the tension, Fifi also honked a few times, but then, when Shrek
wrote the last letter of his name, the tension stopped. Fifi stopped
honking and Rumpelstiltskin was calm, but had a glow of excitement.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
He then cackled villainously as he disappeared in a flash of yellow light.
Then, to Shrek's shock, the pen disappeared and the whole carriage came
apart like a house would in a tornado, and Shrek suddenly found himself
caught in a glowing yellow cyclone, as the parts of the carriage
disappeared. The ogre yelled in alarm as he was tossed all around through

Page 22/82

the air.
Shrek:
Then the yellow background transformed back into the forest setting, only
it was sunny and during the daytime. Shrek came falling from the sky and
crash-landed hard on the ground, with a jingling sound heard upon his
crash.
Shrek:
Then the contract came floating gently down towards the ogre's feet. He
picked it up, getting up, when suddenly, he heard a familiar voice.
Tour Guide's Voice: There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the
weasel goes pop to this very day.
He looked and saw the Star Tours chariot coming his way, to his dismay.
Shrek:
Tour Guide:
across...
Of course, one tourist on the upper deck saw Shrek and did not give a
reaction of happiness. In fact, it was one of alarm.
Tourist:
The group, not recognizing Shrek, saw him and all reacted with horror, and
suddenly the driver lost control as the horses were scared that they ran,
resulting in the chariot to crash into a tree. The tour guide and tourists
all ran off the wrecked chariot, screaming and heading for the hills. Shrek
was a bit surprised at first but then he realized that the magic of the
contract had worked, and people fear him once again. He grinned as he
kissed the piece of paper, before laughing. The song "Top of the World" by
the Carpenters began to play as Shrek left the forest and went on his way
to the nearest village.
He strode merrily towards the unsuspecting villagers.
Such a feeling's coming over me
When the villagers all saw him, they all ran away in separate directions,
screaming, while he continued striding with glee, glad to be feared again.
There is wonder in most everything that I see
We then see a puppet show with one puppet attacking an ogre puppet with a
prop stick, with all the kids watching encouraging the puppet to beat the
ogre.
Kids:
Not a cloud in the sky
Then, without warning, the puppeteer, who turned out to be Shrek, rose his

Page 23/82

head up from the puppet theater's window and roared, making the kids
scream. Then his arms burst through the cardboard, roaring again. The kids
all ran away with Shrek walking up to the seats like a usual ogre would and
then chuckled.
Got the sun in my eyes And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Somewhere else, a wedding was being held in a church. Inside, the priest
gave the permission for the groom to kiss the bride.
Everything I want the world to be
The groom lifted the veil of his bride, who was actually Shrek (in drag),
about to give a kiss. The groom and priest screamed in alarm. Then Shrek
roared at everyone inside the church, making them all scream and leave the
church.
Is now coming true, especially for me
Shrek, the only one left in the church, twirled around, holding the dress
he was wearing.
And the reason is clear It's because you are near
Near a tree, a couple was about to have a picnic when Shrek, in normal
garb, appeared hanging upside-down from a branch, roaring, scaring off the
couple before he took the chicken leg and chomped it.
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I see
Next, we see Shrek scaring a cat, making it screech while jumping up. Then
we see Shrek roaring at a mirror, breaking it. Shrek then got up behind
four men gulping ale, letting out a roar, making them spit out their
drinks. He then went to an old lady with a hearing horn.
Shrek:
The deaf old lady's eyes widened in alarm. Next, at a melon cart, someone
was about to grab a melon, but grabbed Shrek's head, as the ogre was hiding
in the melon cart and he gave yet another roar. Then he went near a goose,
roaring at it, causing the goose to plop out an egg in fear.
I'm on the top of the world Lookin' down on creation And the only
explanation I can find
We then see Shrek happily being chased by an angry mob like the old days,
laughing. He then grabbed a hanging shop's sign, swung over the bar,
removing the sign and leaping onto a roof, surfing over it like a surfboard
and in the process, the surfing removed the shingles. He even surfed onto
another roof, swung around a weather vane, hopped onto another roof and
surfed down that one as well.
Is the love that I found Ever since you've been around
He leaped off the roof, with the villagers angrily tossing their pitchforks
in the air like javelins, while Shrek soared relaxingly, with the
pitchforks missing him.
Your love's put me at the top of the world
The ogre then landed in a hay cart, breaking off a wheel in the process. He

Page 24/82

then leaped out of the hay to declare something to the villagers.
Shrek:
So the villagers all ran away in fear.
Is the love that I found Ever since you've been around
He then leaped off the cart like a diving board and splashed into a pigsty,
startling some pigs upon the splash.
Your love's put me at the top of the world
He then lay back, doing a mud angel, laughing before sighing, glad to feel
like an actual ogre once more.
Later, after Shrek got the mud cleaned off him, he went around the forest,
and saw a Wanted poster for ogres and took it.
Shrek:
nice one.
Then when he saw one more wanted poster, and there was something different
about the others that made his smile disappear. It had the face of a
familiar ogre. He went up closer to it, and saw that it was of Fiona,
giving a fierce look.
Shrek:
He then saw more Wanted posters of Fiona on just about every tree, making
him worried. He even saw a couple with axes and knives pinned at them. As
he saw all the other posters, he began breathing harder.
Shrek:
He then raced out of the forest to get to his home. He raced through a
cornfield, breathing like mad, and when he came to the end of it, he saw
what looked like the structure of his swamp home, except there were no
doors or windows.
Shrek:
However, the structure was very solid when he came up to it.
Shrek:
He then used his ogre strength to pound his way through the soil structure
three times and soon created a hole which he fell in through. He got up and
saw that the place was empty, and not only that but there was no furniture.
It was all a dark underground setting with dirt and roots as far as the eye
can see. He walked around, pushed through some dangling roots, and saw a
rat on one root, before it and other rats scampered away. Shrek then
frowned in anger before leaving the structure.
Shrek:

Page 25/82

deal!
He looked around and saw all the trees in his swamp all dry and leafless.
Not only that, but there was no grass, plants or any swamp water. The place
looked like a complete dried-up wasteland.
Shrek:
But not an answer came. Shrek then dug in his shirt and pulled out the
folded-up contract that he unfolded, and thought to have a better look at
it. Then something flew above him, making a 'woosh' sound. He thought it
was nothing, but then there were two more quick figures flying above him.
He then turned around and saw what appeared to be a pack of witches flying
on their broomsticks. One witch, Broomsy Witch, spotted Shrek down below.
Broomsy:
Shrek gave a confused shrug. The other witches joined Broomsy.
Broomsy:
The witches all cackled as they dove in, flying in a circle around the
swamp.
Shrek:
One laughing witch came swooping right at him, but he grabbed her broom,
and she ended up yelling in alarm as she came crashing towards a tree. She
got caught in the tree with her kicking feet sticking out.
Broomsy:
She got out an apple, used her teeth to pluck out the stem like a grenade
pin and chucked it towards Shrek's feet, to his confusion. Then the apple
started spinning around like mad releasing smoke from it, and when smoke
clouded the spot where Shrek was, he coughed as he tried waving the smoke
away. Then one chain with an iron skull was swung and ensnared Shrek by the
arm. The witches continued cackling as another witch tossed another chain
with a chattering skull to ensnare Shrek by the ankle, and one more chain
grabbed Shrek by the second ankle.
Broomsy:
Shrek yelped as he was pulled by the chains and lifted up in the air by the
witches taking him away. He screamed as he was pulled up, and hit a part of
what would have been the roof of his home along the way out. The witches
cackled some more as they carried their prisoner off.
Broomsy:
Shrek used his fist to break off the chain carrying his arm, forcing him to
drop to the ground, but was still being dragged by the chains carrying his

Page 26/82

legs, grunting as he hit the ground before the witches managed to pull him
back up in the air.
Shrek:
Witch #2:
The witch then threw a flaming pumpkin at him, and once it exploded upon
hitting him, everything went black. Sometime later, Shrek was lying down
asleep somewhere, as a familiar voice was heard singing outside.
Donkey's Voice:
the cobwebs and the sorrow 'Til there's none
When I'm stuck with a day That's gray And lonely
Shrek:
His eyes opened up in realization.
Donkey's Voice:
say
Shrek:
He hit his head on the ceiling.
Shrek:
He then looked and found out he was in some sort of cage on wheels.
Donkey's Voice:
gotta hang on 'til tomorrow
He peeked and saw Donkey, fuzzier, pulling the carriage he was in.
Donkey:
Tomorrow!
Shrek:
There were two witches on top of the cage in charge of driving.
Cage Witch #1:
hate this song.
She whipped Donkey, making him yelp as he sang a different song.
Donkey:
Cage Witch #2:
She took the instrument of torture and gave the donkey another lash.

Page 27/82

Donkey:
The only response was another lash.
Donkey:
The second witch grinned, apparently liking the song as she nudged her
partner, who also liked the song. They even started to sing along.
Donkey and Witches: (singing) They can't take away my dignity Because the
greatest love of all
Shrek:
As the witches kept singing, Donkey quietly spoke to him.
Donkey:
job. I am not going back to work for Old MacDonald. Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That’s what I said.
Shrek:
your wife, Dragon?
Donkey:
donkey. I’ve never seen you before in my life.
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
thing I ever heard!
As Donkey kept pulling the cage, Shrek fumed in frustration.
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
Witch #1:
The second witch whipped Donkey again.
Donkey:
She gave him another lash.

Page 28/82

Donkey:
She gave him another lash, as if taking the lyrics literally.
Donkey:
Shrek then pounded the cage angrily as he saw something definitely
different, and to his horror, it was most of the letters of the Far, Far
Away sign destroyed.
Shrek:
Donkey:
To make matters worse, the green hills of the kingdom were now like a
barren wasteland, and the castle is replaced with a huge fortress of a
castle with a familiar carriage at the top, with a big 'R' on top as well.
As Donkey pulled the cage through the village, Shrek looked on in disgust
at how different Far, Far Away was in this alternate universe. The
villagers were all scrounging for something or living miserably.
Muffin Man's Voice: It’s time to crumble! Place your bets! Place your bets!
Shrek turned, seeing a small crowd gathered around a small makeshift arena,
placing bets, with the Muffin Man holding a spatula with a certain
gingerbread man.
Muffin Man:
Gingy sprung up, but now he had battle scars on his face, chest, and arms,
and was decorated with battle gear and a kilt like a Braveheart character,
and he held up a big lollipop as his weapon.
Gingy:
He gave a battle cry, leaping down onto the small arena while breaking his
lollipop to give it sharp edges.
Shrek:
Then out of three boxes came an assortment of sentient animal crackers
charging at the gingerbread man, but because he now had a fierce
personality, he shouted as he dodged each animal and used his lollipop to
take down his opponents. He even used it to turn and decapitate some of the
animal crackers.
Gingy:
The spectators laughed, enjoying this sport. One of the certain dwarfs, who
was one of the spectators, saw the cage pulling Shrek.
Dwarf:

Page 29/82

All the villagers gathered around with nasty scowls, shouting and jeering
at the ogre prisoner.
Villagers:
Disgusting creature!
One villager chucked an overripe tomato at Shrek's face, with Shrek wiping
it off. The villagers continued shouting nasty remarks towards Shrek as the
cage pulled onward. One villager even chucked a glass bottle at the cage.
The witches, Shrek and Donkey soon made it to the castle, which was now
guarded by witches about every nook and cranny, and there was a shield with
an "R" on the front of the gates, which went up. As they went inside, Shrek
was in horror to see how different the castle grounds looked, and he passed
something he definitely hadn't seen before: two ogres pushing the gear that
controls the gates. The two ogres were miserable because they were being
forced to by another witch with a whip.
Slavery Witch:
She whipped one of the ogres as she cackled evilly.
The gate then closed as the carriage headed to the main hall and stopped
right at the door. Once there, the cage's door was opened, Shrek was let
out but placed in hand-cuffs and shackles around his neck, which were
connected to sticks held by four more witches, as they lead the prisoner to
the doors.
Shrek:
Donkey:
The witches laughed heartlessly while pushing the doors open, and inside
the huge room was a rave party going on with the whole room infested with
witches, dancing and celebrating, with loud rave music playing. They saw
the witches leading the imprisoned ogre through the room as they moved
aside. Shrek glanced at his surroundings, and saw the Three Little Pigs in
servant clothes feeding Fifi some ham. She pecked at it a bit, before
scarfing it all down. He glanced at another corner with a witch band
playing the rave music with a pumpkin drum, a broomstick bass, a skull
xylophone which made synthisizer music, and a huge brewing cauldron. As the
rest of the witches continued dancing and shouting with glee, the witches
that held Shrek prisoner kept leading Shrek across the ballroom. At this
time, at a small corner lined with red VIP ropes in front, a certain deal
maker was in a couch-styled throne (with the ruler's seat being in the
middle), wearing fancy white clothes, laughing and having drinks with four
more witches. Then another witch called out.
Witch:

Page 30/82

He took a sip from a cocktail drink, glancing at the customer with a wide
smirk. The customer was Pinocchio, who was being ushered through the VIP
line by the witch. He turned to Wolf, now dressed as a maid, next to a cart
full of different wigs.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Wolf:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Pinocchio:
Rumpelstiltskin:
The miserable wolf placed a Victorian styled white powdered wig over the
short man.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Pinocchio:
Rumpelstiltskin got out a rolled up contract and smacked the wolf away.
Rumpelstiltskin:
balsa boy.
He rolled out the contract, and pushed it, a quill and an ink jar towards
the puppet, who was eagerly ready to sign.
Pinocchio:
The short man laughed as the puppet started signing.
Shrek:
Then all the music, dancing and talking stopped as all the witches turned
towards the ogre. The deal maker was excited as he stood up on his desk.
Rumpelstiltskin:
As he walked across the desk, he unknowingly knocked over the ink jar,
spilling ink over the spot where Pinocchio signed half his name in cursive.
Pinocchio:
The puppet's arm was grabbed by one of the witches and dragged away from
the table, without Rumpelstiltskin caring to notice.
Rumpelstiltskin:
you!

Page 31/82

He hopped from the table and announced to all the witches.
Rumpelstiltskin:
possible!
They all cheered wildly. Then the deal maker climbed up towards Shrek's
ear, pulling on it and speaking into it.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
He hopped off.
Rumpelstiltskin:
you’ve done. (skips to his table and sits on it) Thanks to you, the King
and Queen signed their kingdom over to me.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
would disappear.
(Flashback)
We see the same moment of Fiona's parents visiting the deal maker to sign a
contract to save their daughter, but this time, it has a different ending.
They signed their names, and then suddenly the king and queen began turning
gold, to their alarm and horror.
Rumpelstiltskin's Voice: And then THEY disappeared!
Queen Lillian:
King Harold:
They then started to fade away.
Both:
The king and queen exploded into gold dust, leaving only their crowns which
dropped onto the table. The evil deal maker then took Harold's crown.
(End of Flashback)
Rumpelstiltskin held out the deceased king's crown, as Shrek realized he
had tricked the king and queen into signing the kingdom and their lives
over. Rumpelstiltskin spun the crown around as he sighed.
Rumpelstiltskin:
would end their daughter’s curse.
Shrek:

Page 32/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
He kicked the crown away.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
spell it out for you! (points to fine print) You gave me a day from your
past, a day you couldn’t even remember. A day when you were an innocent,
mindless little baby.
He walked away, mockingly humming "Happy Birthday", and that's when it
dawned on Shrek.
Shrek:
The dictator held his toes before spreading his legs out.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
up...
Rumpelstiltskin:
He snapped his fingers, and another witch brought over a huge magic
hourglass to the table, rerpesenting the remaining hours of the day.
Rumpelstiltskin:
an end, so will you.
The witches all laughed as Shrek saw the hourglass with the sand running,
which meant the time he had left was running.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
see, you were never born. You never met Fiona. (menacingly) Your kids don’t
exist.
Then the witches all laughed at Shrek's misery, making the ogre more upset.
Rumpelstiltskin even taunted him some more.
Rumpelstiltskin:
you got exactly what you wanted! (mockingly) HAPPY OGRE DAY!!!!
Shrek finally snapped and went for the short man.
Shrek:
He lunged at Rumpelstiltskin, who yelped in alarm as he jumped back.

Page 33/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
A witch fired another skull chain at Shrek, but he sensed it was coming
this time, so he turned and blocked himself with the chains of his cuffs,
just in time for the skull to reach him. The skull chomped the chains,
breaking them. The witches screamed in alarm and panic as Shrek then ripped
the shackles off his neck, growling. Another witch flying on a broomstick
was twirling a skull chain and firing it at Shrek, but he quickly grabbed
it and gave it a yank, pulling the witch down to his level. Shrek and the
witch were face-to-face, with the witch worried what he would do to her.
Outside in the halls, Donkey was speaking to two witches, though it was
hard to tell if they were paying attention or ignoring.
Donkey:
Feet would be comfortable with the breeze on your toes.
Then, without warning, the doors burst open and Shrek came flying through
on the broomstick he took, rather clumsily. He knocked the two witches and
Donkey down in the process, and at this time, "Click Click" by Light FM
started playing. Shrek yelped a bit as he rode a loop-de-loop. Donkey
looked over the edge of the bridge he was on and saw Shrek spiraling
downward before trying to ride the broom on the bottom story, though not
doing very well.
Witch:
Five of the witches leaped off the bridge and onto their broomsticks,
cackling madly as they pursued the ogre throughout the floor. Through the
halls, Shrek still tried getting the hang of flying a broom as the pumpkin
witch chucked pumpkin bombs at him, but he luckily dodged each one. Back on
the top story, Rumpelstiltskin came out, angrily shoving one of the
witches.
Rumpelstiltskin:
witch) Do it!
The short man then saw Shrek flying up towards him with a stern look,
making him yelp. As the ogre on the broom zoomed upward, Rumpelstiltskin's
wig briefly flew off his head from the impact.
Shrek:
He zoomed off, trying to figure out how to shake the witches.
Donkey:
He then looked back at Rumpelstiltskin.
Donkey:

Page 34/82

The witches pursued Shrek through a higher story, and when he came to the
edge and saw a pole, he smirked, getting an idea. Once he came to the pole,
he swung around it and flew back, though rather lop-sided. When the witches
saw him swerving towards them, they all flew out of the way to avoid
getting hit. Shrek then managed to get a decent hold of the broom as he
zoomed back to the bottom floor, dodging more incoming pumpkin bombs. He
came back to the floor where Rumpelstiltskin and Donkey were, stopped the
broom and glared at the foe.
Donkey:
The dictator ran off as Shrek then swooped in, but instead of going after
the deal maker who stole his birth, he scooped up Donkey in one swipe and
flew into another room, with Donkey screaming for help.
Donkey:
Shrek saw the skylight up above, and he smirked, getting an escape idea.
Donkey:
With the witches still on the ogre's tail, he swung around the golden chain
of a huge shiny ball hung as the castle's centerpiece. He grabbed the
chain, and began to twirl around the room while holding the chain, using
the ball to smash everything in its path, with the witches (the ones who
weren't chasing Shrek) all screaming as they ran to avoid getting crushed
by the ball or the debris. While this happened, Rumpelstiltskin could only
watch helplessly and in despair.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The witches continued pursuing Shrek, with the ogre and donkey getting
closer to the skylight, with Donkey screaming and Shrek yelling.
Shrek:
The two then smashed straight through the skylight with the ball getting
jammed in the hole, and the flying witches' brooms getting pinned to the
ball itself, and some fell off, screaming, and landed on the floor.
Outside, Shrek and Donkey zoomed off and away from the castle, with Donkey
still screaming. Back in the castle, the ball didn't have anything to latch
itself to, so it didn't take long for the ball itself to creak loudly,
before falling back and crashing into the ground with a very loud thump.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The witch maids walked away in worry while Wolf removed the business wig
and replaced it with a new one, which was a tall, red, fiery wig that
resembled either Syndrome's hair from the Incredibles or a Troll doll's
hair. Wolf walked away as well before the dictator breathed in anger.

Page 35/82

With Shrek and Donkey, the two continued riding the broom, with the latter
still panicking and struggling to get out of the ogre's grip.
Donkey:
Shrek:
Then they ended up crashing through a tree, and it looked like Donkey was
riding the broom with Shrek holding onto the edge. Then, as they crashed
through another tree, and it looked like Shrek was riding the broom
backwards with Donkey riding on the bottom, upside-down. Then, after
crashing through another tree, the two ended up flying off the broomstick
and on the ground hard, with Shrek on his back and Donkey on the ogre's
stomach. Donkey then looked very worried, and then, the next thing you
know, he was running for his life with the ogre chasing after him.
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek then tackled his best friend, who was still terrified of the ogre.
Donkey:
Shrek:
friend.
Donkey:
Shrek:
He nodded, though in fear.
Shrek:
Once Shrek removed his hand, Donkey still panicked.
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
He then thought of the only way to convince Donkey, but he shook his head,
not believing he was about to do it.

Page 36/82

Shrek:
He got up and started to sing while dancing a bit, and wasn't particularly
good at carrying a tune.
Shrek:
call And I'll be there, ye, ye, ye You've got a friend
Donkey then got up, with his look of fear fading away, and he began to grin
warmly. It looked like for a minute, Donkey recognized his best friend and
was about to embrace him but instead, he ran away, screaming some more. The
ogre was left dumbstruck.
Shrek:
He then miserably walked through the forest and sat down on a log, but upon
sitting, a squeaky noise was heard. He reached from his pocket and pulled
out the source of the noise, Felicia's squeaky ogre toy. He stared at it
and held it sadly, knowing he'll never see Fiona or his kids again. Then,
as a tear began streaming from his eye, he held his head down.
Donkey's Voice:
He turned and saw Donkey right next to him. He then wiped the tear away.
Shrek:
Donkey:
thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma
kissing a baby kitten, (choking up) or a little baby grandma kitten.
(starts to cry himself) That is so darn sad.
Shrek:
Donkey:
of my business why you’re upset. By the way, why are you upset?
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
Rumpelstiltskin!
Shrek:

Page 37/82

Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is.
Shrek:
exit clause in here.
Donkey:
let me show you how it’s done.
He grabbed the contract with his teeth and placed it on the ground,
starting to fold the paper.
Donkey:
picking up a few tricks. Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn’t begin to
comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills.
Shrek:
Donkey:
you.
Shrek rolled his eyes and sighed as Donkey continued folding.
Shrek:
this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just
right, it will show you what to do.
Then Shrek saw that Donkey's paper folding started to from letters together
to form the exit clause. Once Donkey was finished, he showed the folded up
paper to the ogre.
Donkey:
Shrek only gave a confused look.
Donkey:
Shrek:
He snatched the paper and did some folding himself, and then it showed a

Page 38/82

heart with the TRUE words of the exit clause: "True Love's Kiss".
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
satisfied, true love’s kiss will render this contract null and void."
Donkey, you did it!
He then picked Donkey up and hugged him, with Donkey struggling.
Shrek:
get my life back!
Donkey:
Fiona?
Shrek:
Donkey:
steps. So, where did you leave her last?
Shrek:
rescued her.
His eyes widened in realization.
Shrek:
Shrek knew the only place to look was the place he first rescued her: the
dragon's keep, and that's where he went, with Donkey following. This time,
there was no lava surrounding the castle. Shrek ran across the bridge,
hoping to find Fiona.
Donkey:
That’s the Dragon’s Keep! They keep dragons in there!
He tried running across to stop the ogre, but he screamed when one of the
boards he stepped on broke, so he quickly went back.
Donkey:
find us some breakfast!
Not paying attention to Donkey, Shrek just raced through the castle,
breathing desperately. Thankfully, since Dragon wasn't there either for
some reason, Shrek had no trouble making it to the stairs leading to the
highest room in the tallest tower. He ran up those stairs and burst the
door open, causing pigeons in the room to scatter.

Page 39/82

Shrek:
He looked and saw the bed where he first found Fiona deserted, and the
curtains and sheets were all ripped. That's not all he saw. He saw
something behind the tapestry of a knight on a steed. He went over, pushing
the tapestry aside, seeing markings on the stone wall. They were tallies of
all the days Fiona has been locked in the tower. Shrek tore the tapestry
off, and the whole wall was marked with tallies. Shrek put his hand on the
wall in regret, and then depressingly went over to the bed, and there he
saw Fiona's princess tiara.
Shrek:
He picked up the tiara, sat down and held it in his hands.
Shrek:
He then noticed another object on the ground, and that object was the
handkerchief Fiona gave Shrek on the day he rescued her. He picked it up
and held it as well.
Soon, he returned from the castle, holding the handkerchief.
Shrek:
we met.
Donkey looked surprised.
Shrek:
Donkey's face) Now smell it!
Donkey:
Shrek:
so stop complaining and start smelling. (waves it in front of Donkey) Smell
it! Get it! Away you go, girl!
Donkey:
noticed, I’m a donkey, not a dog! If I was a dog, they’d call me Dog, not
Donkey! And another thing...
Then he started sniffing.
Donkey:
He sniffed the air some more, walking around a bit.
Donkey:
Shrek:

Page 40/82

Donkey:
Shrek:
The donkey then abruptly rose his head up, and dashed off into the forest.
Shrek:
Donkey started sniffing the ground in the forest like a bloodhound, and to
his surprise and happiness, he saw an unguarded plate of stacked waffles
coated in syrup sitting on a stump.
Donkey:
bedtime story. (rushes up to plate) Sticky stacks of golden, syrupy
deliciousness!
Shrek:
Donkey stopped and frowned.
Shrek:
forest. Don’t you find that a wee bit suspicious?
Donkey only gave an "I don't know" kind of mumble before trying to take a
little nibble of the waffles, but Shrek kept protesting against it.
Shrek:
you...? Bad Donkey! Mustn’t--I said, don’t! Don’t! No! Get away from it.
But Donkey extended his tongue out and licked the dripping syrup of the
waffles.
Shrek:
Then, without warning, the plate flung the waffles onto a tree. Donkey
quickly realized it was a trap.
Donkey:
The stump flipped open like a lid and looked at the hole, rather confused
because it didn't seem like an effective trap to him. However, that was not
the full trap. Shrek glanced around, seeing hidden pulleys and
counterweights turning, and then a log came swinging out to the direction
of the two.
Shrek:
But Donkey didn't duck in time, as he got hit in the end by the log,
sending him into the hole. The ogre ran up to the hole, lifting the lid,
seeing Donkey lying there.

Page 41/82

Shrek:
Donkey:
But then his hooves got snagged by a rope trap and he was yanked away,
screaming.
Shrek:
He leaped into the hole and saw it led to a tunnel, and because it was
small to walk through, he had to crawl through it.
Donkey's Voice:
Then he came out through the other end, pushing the roots, and when getting
up, he was awestruck at where he was. He was in some hidden camp with ogres
like him roaming about, carrying stuff and doing chores. He wandered around
in amazement, looking at the sights, making him grin a bit. A blacksmith
ogre was sharpening a tool and a female ogre was carrying an anvil of some
sort. As Shrek kept wandering, two ogres carrying a log were coming from
behind him.
Ogre #1:
He then ducked, letting the two ogres lift the log over him. Then three
ogres, including a female one named Gretched, came around him.
Ogre #2:
Ogre #3:
Gretched:
Ogre #2:
Then, a slender ogre taller than Shrek, known as Brogan, came behind our
main ogre, putting his arm around him.
Brogan:
thankful. Suit him up!
The other ogres then took Shrek to get suited up.
Ogre #3:
Shrek:
He was placed on an armor vest, along with some wrist bands, and a helmet.
One ogre smacked him in the rear to get him going.
Shrek:

Page 42/82

Brogan:
An axe was tossed into Shrek's arms, which Shrek luckily caught. Three
ogres each threw an axe at three different dummies wearing witch's clothes.
One ogre even tackled a witch dummy, and brawled with it. Shrek
Brogan:
Shrek:
Brogan:
everywhere!
He then held his nose and started blowing a toot through his ears, and
then, all the other ogres held their noses and blew through their ears.
When the blowing was done, the resistance ogres hooted and laughed while
Shrek was even more stunned than already.
Shrek:
Suddenly, he heard a certain donkey yelling for help, and he turned to see
Donkey being carried upside-down by two ogres and tied to some sticks.
Donkey:
all poi...
But one of the ogres stuffed an apple in his mouth, resulting in Donkey to
yell, muffled. Then Shrek grabbed Donkey by the sticks.
Shrek:
One of the ogres carrying him, a chef ogre named Cookie then grabbed the
sticks.
Cookie:
Shrek:
Donkey:
The two ogres ended up having a tug-of-war with Donkey.
Shrek:
Cookie:
Shrek:
Brogan came over, trying to break up the two.

Page 43/82

Brogan:
Cookie:
Then, a horn was sounded, stopping the fight and getting all ogres' and
Donkey's attention.
Ogre #4:
Shrek turned and saw a figure arriving on the hill, who was clad with a
helmet and armor, and holding an axe in her hand. She removed her helmet,
and revealed to be none other than Fiona (in ogre form). She stood there,
with the wind blowing her hair, giving it a dramatic flare. When Shrek saw
her, he grinned in so much relief.
Shrek:
He began running up to Fiona, who noticed Shrek running up to her.
Shrek:
Of course, because Shrek was never born, Fiona did not accept/return the
embrace. Instead, before Shrek could hug her, she lifted up her foot and
kicked Shrek in the face, sending him flying, yelling in slow-motion,
before crashing to the ground. The ogres winced while some couldn't help
but chuckle a bit. The groaning Shrek got up as Fiona walked up, handing
her axe to Gretched, and her helmet to Brogan.
Fiona:
personal space is very important to me.
Shrek then looked very worried.
Shrek:
Fiona:
the others and meet me in the war room.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Needless to say, she gave a confused look.

Page 44/82

Shrek:
puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept
saying, "Do the roar. Do the roar. Do the roar."
As he explained and tried making it sound as believable as he could, Brogan
and Gretched were equally as confused as Fiona.
Shrek:
I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole.
Needless to say as well, pretty much all ogres that weren't Shrek, were
completely dumbstruck, and so was Donkey.
Shrek:
Fiona:
than I thought.
The ogres in the resistance laughed a bit.
Shrek:
But she held his hand up, as a lookout ogre was perched on a lookout,
making "caw" sounds.
Fiona:
She and the other ogres (except Shrek) went to their battle stations.
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek grabbed Donkey and the sticks he was still attached to.
Shrek:
Some of the ogres cut some ropes, closing up the big holes some ogres hid
in just in time, and dropping sand bags on fires, putting them out. The
weapons were placed in a net which was hoisted upwards, and then a couple
ogres hid in a hole underground, putting a cover over the hiding place.
Some other ogres, wearing rocks and plants on their heads, held their
breaths as they ducked down into some swamp water, and the remaining ogres
(Fiona and Brogan included) with bush disguises gathered around the spot
where Shrek was and crouched down. With that, every last ogre and the camp
itself was completely hidden from sight. Shrek covered the whimpering
Donkey's mouth, while the ogres looked up, and saw three of the witches
flying up over the forest on their brooms. The lead witch glanced down at
the forest, not finding any ogres or the camp, and gave a sneer. The
witches then flew off, retreating to Rumpelstiltskin's castle. Once they
were gone, the ogres came from their hiding place, murmuring while heading

Page 45/82

back to their posts.
Brogan:
Fiona:
Shrek and Donkey just sat where they were.
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
The ogre gave a weird look at the donkey.
Back at Rumpelstiltskin's palace, the dictator, not wearing any wigs, was
staring at the hour glass with the sands of Shrek's time running, and he
gave a sigh.
Rumpelstiltskin:
empty.
He then turned to a table where some of his witches was sitting, and each
had her own cupcake.
Rumpelstiltskin:
from the bottom to the top, ladies, but we’re not just an empire, we’re a
family. Everyone has got their cupcake? Cupcake? Cupcake? Good. Yes? (to
one of the witches) Baba?
The witch named Baba nodded.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He then walked around the table as he continued.
Rumpelstiltskin:
And so one got away. Who cares? It’s not a big deal. It doesn’t matter to
me.
One of the witches who was eating her cupcake, nodded in agreement.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Then he came to the edge of the table, with the tone of his voice becoming
a bit more sharp.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He motioned the witch he was near to help him upon top of the table and
that's what she did, and the villain began to rant.

Page 46/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek! (with frustration raising in his voice) And if he shares a kiss with
Fiona by sunrise, it IS the end of the world! OUR world! MY EMPIRE!!
Fifi, resting nearby, honked loudly. Then Rumpelstiltskin exhaled, calming
down a bit, as he continued speaking more calmly, though his voice still
had a hint of danger to it.
Rumpelstiltskin:
pours it into glass) I like to look at the goblet as half full.
The witches gasped and whimpered in fear, knowing that he might use it to
melt any one of them.
Rumpelstiltskin:
some water?
He began to walk across the table and shove the glass of water in one of
the panicked witches' faces.
Rumpelstiltskin:
She shook her head 'no' in fear as he slyly walked over to another panicked
witch.
Rumpelstiltskin:
purificada?
She nervously declined as well.
Rumpelstiltskin:
pitcher down) Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it’s going to
take to get this ogre?!
He narrowed his eyes and pointed to Broomsy Witch.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Broomsy Witch:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Hat Witch:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Witch:
He shouted and stomped his feet in frustration before splashing the water
onto the witch, melting her like a certain other witch.

Page 47/82

Witch:
Soon, as the steam cleared and there was nothing left of that witch but a
soggy pile of her clothes. Then, Rumpelstiltskin pondered at the
suggestion.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Baba!
Baba jumped out of her chair in fear.
Rumpelstiltskin:
the savage beast...(chortles evilly a bit) then I think I might know just the
person!
He dipped his finger in the frosting of the cupcake and licked the frosting
right off, giving a malicious grin.
Back at the resistance camp, a meeting was being held inside a tree, with
Shrek and Donkey, who was untied, looking from the outside through some
holes in the trees. Shrek has gathered Brogan, Gretched, Cookie, and some
other ogres to discuss a battle plan, which was set out on a rock table,
with little model figures and everything.
Fiona:
Stiltskin is leading tonight’s ogre hunt himself.
The ogres started murmuring.
Ogres:
Donkey:
Shrek:
Brogan:
his filthy witch nest, he’ll be vulnerable.
Fiona:
She starts moving a model of the carriage with a couple witches along a
path, with the ogre models off to the side and Fiona's model on top of a
cliff.
Fiona:
river by midnight. We’ll be concealed along this road, waiting for his
caravan. Once they reach the clearing, I’ll give the signal.
Fiona pressed the top of her model's head, making its arm raise up a sword
it had, which would be the signal.

Page 48/82

Fiona:
He raised her actual dagger and used it to slide the ogre models toward the
witch models, knocking the latter down and off the table.
Fiona:
Then she noticed a model of Cookie with some sort of wagon.
Fiona:
Cookie:
Fiona:
Cookie:
ambush, okay?
She only gave a small smirk, deciding to humor him.
Cookie:
Fiona:
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten. Far Far Away
will finally be free.
Brogan:
Fiona:
palace.
The other ogres chattered in agreement, while outside, Shrek and Donkey
looked concerned.
Donkey:
Shrek:
to kiss me before sunrise?
Donkey:
Shrek:
He only gave a scoff.
Donkey:
you’re her true love and you came from an alternate universe.
Shrek:

Page 49/82

that you’re married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.
Hearing this made the Donkey stunned and interested a bit.
Donkey:
Shrek:
Donkey:
He then glanced at a frog nearby, getting a new idea.
Shrek:
He then blew the frog up like a balloon exactly like he did before.
Shrek:
Shrek started to head inside Fiona's tent. He peered his head inside.
Donkey:
Shrek:
He went inside with the frog balloon tied to a string attached to a small
gift basket he had. He looked around, seeing a shield and weapons hung up,
and a play tower/scratching post for cats. In fact, two familiar cat eyes
appeared in the hole.
Puss's Voice:
Shrek:
Suddenly, Puss's lower half started squeezing out, only something was
different about it: it was bigger and more round. The cat grunted and
squeezed out of the hole, finally revealing what he looked like in this
world: a tubby orange cat, currently wearing nothing but a bow around his
neck.
Shrek:
The orange cat slid down the scratching post very slowly and plopped onto a
purple pillow at the foot of the tower. He struggled a bit to get up, but
he eventually sat up and gave his usual glare towards foes.
Puss:
Shrek:
The orange cat glared, knowing he was about to say the obvious word.

Page 50/82

Shrek:
Puss:
Shrek:
boots?
Puss:
He groaned while getting up and staggering toward some cream bottles and a
bowl.
Shrek:
Puss:
outgrown.
Shrek:
Puss:
have let myself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was
the best decision of my life. I have all the cream I can drink and all the
mice I can chase.
A mouse appeared, licking from the bowl and the cat glanced at it.
Puss:
He licked from the bowl, which he was apparently sharing with the mouse.
Shrek put his hands on the sides of his head in dismay.
Shrek:
The orange cat went back to his pillow.
Puss:
He laid back in relaxation.
Shrek:
me get a kiss from Fiona.
At this time, Fiona came back and was not happy to see Shrek inside her
tent without permission.
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:

Page 51/82

Shrek:
rallying the troops, planning attacks and all that, so I brought you a
little something to ease the tension.
He held up the gift basket, but she didn't seem impressed.
Fiona:
Shrek:
He then got out each different gift from the basket.
Shrek:
He sniffed the candle.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Let’s see, "Good for one free foot massage." "A mud facial!" Oh, and here’s
one.
He came to one that had a childish drawing of his face on it.
Shrek:
Fiona:
run a revolution. So unless you have Rumpelstiltskin’s head in there, I
suggest you take your gift basket, get out of my tent and go make yourself
useful! Wow.
Shrek:
friendly. (holds out hand) No hard feelings?
Fiona decided to shake his hand.
Shrek:
The two hugged.
Shrek:
Fiona:
She quickly stopped him, grabbed his arm and placed it behind his back,
forcing him to leave.
Shrek:

Page 52/82

He was then thrown out of the tent on his back before Donkey came to him
with a grin.
Donkey:
uncomfortable?
Back inside the tent,
Fiona:
Puss, meanwhile, looked at his own reflection in the shield, and thought
about the little talk between him and Shrek.
Puss:
soft?
Fiona then got out a comb and crush.
Fiona:
Puss:
Back at the palace, the three pigs were busy taking care of Fifi, and they
were disgusted with doing so. Heimlich was in charge of scrubbing the
goose's teeth (yes, goose don't normally have teeth, but this one does
apparently), Horst was in charge of trimming her toenails, and Dieter was
in charge of scrubbing her with a big soap brush and he plunged the brush
into the suds bowl in annoyance. Rumpelstiltskin came over to his giant pet
and cuddled her by the head.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He carressed her a bit, as she honked.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He then turned to the pigs with a scowl.
Rumpelstiltskin:
her little potty box with you.
Dieter and Heimlich then carried the potty box away in disgust, with Horst
following and spraying some perfume to drown any odors. Fifi then snipped
Horst in the curly tail, making him yelp.
Horst:
When the pigs were gone, a witch named Griselda came running in.
Griselda:
Rumpelstiltskin sat back on his throne with a couple other witches at his
side.

Page 53/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
The bounty hunter then came in through the doors, playing a flute, and he
was approaching the throne, but not using his arms and legs to do so.
Instead, he used a magic flute to make a small pack of mice carrying him
all the way on their backs. Once the bounty hunter was revealed in front of
the dictator and witches, the mice scampered off. He was in fact the Pied
Piper.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Instead of speaking, the piper communicated by playing a few notes.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Griselda:
gonna do, (motions flute playing) flute those ogres a lullaby?
She and the other three witches chortled, while Rumpelstiltskin gave a nod
to the piper, who nodded back, and then he turned the setting on the end of
his flute from mouse to duck to witch. He then started playing a new song
on the flute while beatboxing, and to the surprise of the witches,
Griselda's arms began moving by themselves. Then she yelped as she started
involuntarily breakdancing to the song, which is "Sure Shot" by the Beastie
Boys, and the other two witches involuntarily got up and started dancing
against their will as well, yelling in alarm.
Griselda:
Rumpelstiltskin just laughed at this, enjoying it. The dancing and song
lasted for a bit, before the dictator got up, waving his arms.
Rumpelstiltskin:
With that, the witches' dancing halted, ending with involuntary dancer
poses as the three panted, and the piper ended his tune. Rumpelstiltskin
gave an evil look.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The witches still stood where they were.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Now go get my checkbook!
The two witches left and Griselda got up to get the checkbook, but the
impatient Rumpelstiltskin kicked her rear.
Rumpelstiltskin:
around here!

Page 54/82

The piper then switched the setting from witch to unicorn to his
commissioned setting: ogre.
Back at the resistance camp, Shrek had been put to kitchen duties by
Cookie. He was now wearing a hair net (despite the fact he had no hair) and
a smock. Cookie handed Shrek a bowl of the usual food ogres eat.
Cookie:
empty stomach! (pushes Shrek out) Go on! (smacks him in the rear) Go!
So Shrek went to the other dining ogres as Cookie called out to them.
Cookie:
The ogres cheered, ready for some grub. Shrek poured some eyeballs into one
ogre's bowl. One other ogre slurped up a snake like a spaghetti noodle,
another ate cockroaches and onions straight off a shish kabob stick,
another chomped into a worm burger (with some remaining roaches scattering
all over him), and one more ogre slurped up a whole string of snails
attached together. Donkey was at one of the tables with the ogres,
surprisingly not as dinner but as a guest.
Ogre #5:
Donkey:
Shrek stopped just to take a glance at what Donkey was doing. Donkey dunked
his snout into a bowl of eyeballs.
Brogan:
He raised his head back up, closed his eyes and then let out a snort,
causing two eyeballs (the ones from the bowl, not his own) to pop out of
his nostrils. Shrek yelped in surprise and disgust, but the other ogres, on
the other hand, all laughed heartily because they found the trick
hilarious.
Donkey:
The ogres (minus Shrek) continued laughing hysterically.
Donkey:
never gonna see another one like I had with you
Brogan then spoke to Shrek.
Brogan:
haven’t eaten him.
Donkey:
Shrek chose this time to set down next to Donkey.

Page 55/82

Shrek:
away from your adoring public, but I’m not getting anywhere with Fiona.
Shrek then pulled the trick eyeballs out of Donkey's nostrils.
Shrek:
Cookie:
Shrek saw that Cookie had one of his gifts for Fiona and threw it onto the
table. The ogres were eager for it as they chattered each wanting a piece
of it, they took everything, from the lid to the slugs inside. They even
eagerly ripped the box itself, leaving nothing but the heart-shaped base at
the bottom, which was ripped in half, looking ironically like a broken
heart, to Shrek's dismay.
Ogre #3:
Cookie:
boy.
The ogres (minus Shrek) all laughed, and even Donkey couldn't help but
giggle.
Donkey:
Then he got a glare from Shrek, making him stop giggling.
Ogre #3:
her.
Gretched:
The resistance ogres laughed a bit some more.
Shrek:
Donkey:
her cause.
Brogan:
Ogres (minus Shrek): (raising their fists) To the cause!
They cheered a bit, before continuing their eating.
Donkey:
Then Shrek had an epiphany, knowing the only way he could possibly get
close to this world's Fiona in order to save himself.
In Fiona's tent, the resistance leader herself was practicing

Page 56/82

witch-striking while blindfolded, waiting for any witches to strike. A
cardboard witch dummy popped up from a corner and she threw a spinning axe
at it, directly chopping through the dummy's head. Then another witch dummy
came sliding down a pulley, and the blindfolded Fiona chucked another axe
at it, directly hitting it and cutting it in half. Then she heard the sound
of a dummy of a witch on a cage wagon creeping in the distance, as well as
another dummy witch popping up in front. She used her foot to spring a
spear up off the ground, take the spear and throw it like a javelin at the
dummy, knocking it off and hitting the witch-on-cage dummy as well. The
spear sent both dummies smack dab onto a tree. Shrek then appeared, wearing
a helmet and iron bracelets around his wrists.
Shrek:
She sprung her axe and got ready to swing it, and as it got near Shrek's
head, he screamed a bit. Fiona lifted her blindfold to see who it was.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Oh, yeah. I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an
operational...op.
He picked out a spiky tool from a nearby weapon bucket.
Shrek:
Fiona:
He got out another weapon.
Fiona:
with.
Shrek:
He then got out an axe.
Fiona:
Then, to the ogre's surprise, the axe was part mace. He chuckled a bit,
swinging it around before the axe part snapped off the chain and spun
towards a witch dummy, landing smackdab in the head's center. He chuckled a
bit again, impressed by the accidentally successful hit, but then when he
leaned on the weapon bucket, he knocked it over. He tried picking it up,
but he ended up knocking some witch dummies and more stuff over, yelping in
the progress. The noises woke up Puss, who was sleeping on an upper ledge.

Page 57/82

Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Then, without warning, she threw a shield against him as a song began to
play.
Fiona:
She then started to assault him with a huge hammer, which he used his
shield to block. This was some type of training.
Shrek:
Golden leaves looked brown to me
She continued trying to hit him as he blocked her with the shield.
Shrek:
The world had less color without you
He then spotted a spiky club lying on the ground. He took it used it to
attack Fiona back, hitting her shield hard and sending her down. She
blocked herself, and it appeared that she was whimpering, to Shrek's
concern.
Shrek:
Of course, she was faking it as she got back up and smacked Shrek with her
weapon.
Fiona:
Shapes in the sky look plain to my eyes
The two ogres then started attacking/blocking each other for a few moments,
until Fiona kicked Shrek to the wall, hitting a dummy with a gourd for a
head.
The world had less color without you
Shrek got back up and hit Fiona's shield with his axe, then Fiona hit Shrek
with a big log, which he blocked with his shield. Then Shrek grabbed a huge
mace to strike Fiona with, which she blocked. Shrek was enjoying this
practice, but then his eyes widened upon seeing Fiona with a huge uprooted
tree. She whacked Shrek, sending him down, and both ogres laughed.
Without you
Shrek got out and the next thing you know, both ogres started punching each
other.

Page 58/82

I know plenty of people with eyes closed
They kept on punching until Shrek stopped Fiona's fists, with the two
breathing as they looked at each other. Puss was still watching and gave an
amazed look at the chemistry between the ogres.
They don't see you like I do Darling I do
Then one of the bracelets fell off Shrek's wrist.
Fiona:
She picked it up.
Fiona:
He gave her his hand and she started to retie it onto his wrist.
Fiona:
finally...
Shrek:
Fiona was surprised to find that Shrek knew the same tying rhyme as she
did, and the two then gazed at each other.
I do Darling I do Darling I do
Puss:
See you
Then Fiona shook the feeling out of her.
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
She headed off to get ready herself, and Shrek tried to speak out, but
didn't know what to say, and looked down, for he had once again failed to
get a kiss from her. So as all ogres began preparing all their weapons,
Shrek just walked through the camp dejectedly.
Brogan:
packed! Preparation is half the battle!
Then, Puss began running after the dejected ogre, breathing heavily.
Puss:

Page 59/82

Just give me a minute.
Shrek:
Puss:
and Fiona. There was a spark, a spark inside her heart I thought was long
extinguished. It was as if, for one moment, Fiona had actually found her
true love!
Shrek:
Hearing that surprised Puss.
Puss:
Shrek:
(Flashback)
We see a flashback of Fiona, in her human form, in the tower, shedding some
tears as the sun was going down. She then laid down, and in a flash, she
magically transformed into her ogre form, as part of the spell, and she lay
there sorrowfully.
Shrek's Voice:
first kiss, and then take love's true form.
(End of Flashback)
Puss gasped, stunned at the words Shrek said.
Puss:
You must prove it to her!
Shrek:
Puss:
something that only her true love would know.
Then Donkey just popped up out of nowhere.
Donkey:
The fat orange cat screeched from being startled, and hissed at the donkey.
Donkey:
At Rumpelstiltskin's castle, the gate opened with some of the witches
coming out, holding lanterns, followed by the carriage pulled by Fifi. At
this time, Fiona was leading the ogres, all clad in armor, through the
forest to be ready for the ambush. Shrek was trying to make his way through
the ogre army though.

Page 60/82

Shrek:
Bringing up the rear, Puss, riding a small cart pulled by Donkey, spotted
Cookie's chimichanga cart up ahead.
Puss:
Donkey's back) Andale! After him, burro! Donkey, vmonos!
Donkey:
Puss:
Then both shortly paused before they bursted out laughing, not helping but
finding both their puns funny. Then once the army came to the edge of the
forest, Fiona signaled them to stop.
Fiona:
She went up ahead, and the other ogres, except Shrek obviously, went to
take positions to hide. Fiona saw a nearby hanging tree branch, grabbed it
and swung over it, landing on a higher hill.
Brogan:
The ogres then climbed up some trees, and others donned disguises of bushes
and rocks, taking their hiding positions. Fiona then came to the top of a
slope where the carriage should be arriving. Shrek then appeared right
beside her.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
ogres, Rumpel, your curse.
Her eyes widened in shock, before she pulled out her dagger and held it
closely towards Shrek's chin.
Fiona:
Shrek:
everything.
Meanwhile, because of Shrek distracting her, neither of the two saw the

Page 61/82

carriage and witches, who were flying on their broomsticks, arriving this
way. The ogres were still awaiting Fiona's signal.
Brogan:
Gretched:
Cookie:
Brogan:
He then gave a signal to one of the ogres in one of the trees. That ogre
nodded, pulling the rope, which two of the witches flew into, knocking them
off their brooms. The ogre army then yelled as they charged at the
carriage, taking down some more witches along the way, and then ripping the
carriage apart, chunk by chunk. However, to their surprise and confusion,
Rumpelstiltskin was not there. Then Fifi, who looked more wooden than real,
let out a flute-like squeak rather than a honk, to the ogres' notice. Then
they saw "Fifi" come apart, revealing to be the Pied Piper in a wooden Fifi
disguise. He whipped out his flute halves, placing them together, and
beginning to play it.
Back with Shrek and Fiona, the latter threw the former down, threatening
him with the dagger.
Fiona:
curse, but if any of these ogres find out I'm...
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
that birds explode.
Fiona:
Shrek:
"I".
Fiona:

Shrek:
fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish.
Hearing that, her expression of anger faded away as she let him go. He got
up as he continued.
Shrek:
feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close
your eyes...you're afraid you're gonna wake up back in that tower.
Fiona was amazed that he actually knew her more than she thought, and he
looked at her tenderly.
Shrek:
turn human every day is because you've never been kissed....well...by me.
The two then joined hands together, and suddenly, from the distance, flute
music was heard, and suddenly, Fiona grabbed the yelping Shrek, dipping him
like in a dance.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Then the two involuntarily got back up, holding their arms out. As the
music picked up, the two held each others' hands and started dancing away
from the hill.
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Where the rest of the ogres were, they all began dancing unwillingly, as
the Piper was playing a flute-beatbox version of "Shake Your Groove Thing"
by Peaches & Herb. Brogan was panicking as he continued dancing under the
flute's power.
Brogan:
Cookie, on the other hand, was getting jiggy with the dance spell.
Cookie:
He put his hand to his side, making a sizzle sound. Shrek and Fiona danced
near the ogre army, and ended up in the center of them, with Fiona spotting

Page 63/82

the Piper.
Fiona:
and it's all because of you!
Shrek:
Fiona:
Then Shrek involuntarily picked up Fiona in his arms and tossed her the
air, with the ogres unwillingly tossing their shields up, giving some sort
of atmosphere with Fiona in the air. Fiona then landed back down in Shrek's
arms, as all the ogres continued dancing in a line and pointing their
fingers like in a disco dance, under the Piper's musical spell. Puss and
Donkey, still unaffected by the spell (because the setting was only to
ogre), saw this and Puss was concerned while Donkey was bobbing along to
the flute-beatboxing.
Puss:
oblivion!
Donkey:
Puss:
Donkey:
Puss:
He got out his claws and clawed Donkey's rear, making him scream and neigh
like a horse, oddly enough for some reason, as he began racing down the
hill and toward the line of dancing ogres. Donkey knocked Shrek and Fiona
out of the line and onto the cart, racing away. Despite them being away
from the Piper, the two ogres still pointed their fingers out like in a
disco dance.
Puss:
Donkey:
Of course, he spoke too soon, as he didn't look to see they were heading
for a chasm, and he didn't stop at the edge in time, resulting in the four
to be sent falling into the chasm, screaming, before splashing into the
water below.
A bit later, the four managed to reach dry land, recovering from the crash
and splash. Shrek tried to fit one of the bracelets back on one his wrists,
and it did because it didn't rust when hitting the water. Fiona just sighed

Page 64/82

in annoyance however. Puss tried to lick himself clean, but due to his
ball-like girth, he could not reach his back half. He then turned to the
drenched donkey, who was licking himself.
Puss:
Donkey:
The orange fat cat started doing his 'big eyes' trick.
Donkey:
down.
His eyes grew even bigger, until the groaning Donkey finally gave in.
Donkey:
Donkey took a deep breath and stuck his tongue out, ready to lick the cat,
though he was disgusted to do so.
Shrek:
He saw Fiona heading up the path to a bridge and holding the lantern, with
Shrek following.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:
Fiona:
Puss:
Fiona:
She continued to storm away and cross the bridge above.
Shrek:
Fiona:
Shrek:

Page 65/82

Fiona:
Shrek:
everything!
The female ogre then stopped in her tracks and turned, thinking that he
would not be able to take a hint any other way. So he went up towards him,
grabbed him and gave him a kiss, and the night background changed to a
glowing background of yellow, and for a minute, it looked like everything
would revert to normal, but alas, it did not. When the kiss ended and Shrek
opened his eyes, everything about the alternate world was all as it was,
including Fiona, frowning bitterly as she wiped her lip. Even Puss and
Donkey were puzzled at how everything was the same.
Shrek:
kiss was supposed to fix everything!
Fiona:
didn't get me out of that tower. I did. I saved myself. Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.
Shrek:
Fiona:
keep? Did you live all alone in a miserable tower? Did you cry yourself to
sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?!
Shrek:
Fiona:
She then picked up her lantern, leaving the three alone on the bridge, to
rescue her friends herself. Shrek just stood there, completely heartbroken,
knowing now that all his chances of ever getting a kiss from Fiona and
saving his own life are gone.
Donkey:
Shrek:
me.
Inside the castle, all the ogres were yelling as they were now in cages
dangling from the ceiling.
Brogan:
they can't cage our honour!
Down below, the Piper was flute-speaking frantically to Rumpelstiltskin,

Page 66/82

explaining the situation, and the villain was furious.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He frantically flute-spoke some more.
Rumpelstiltskin:
in rage) toot-a-lee-toots! YOU BLEW IT!
He then turned to Wolf.
Rumpelstiltskin:
She squeaked, stammered and stood up straight.
Rumpelstiltskin:
socks up.
He set the setting to socks and played his flute so Rumpelstiltskin's socks
could be slithered up his legs tight like magic.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Then, somewhere in a market place, the Magic Mirror's face appeared in a
mirror hanging in a shop (along with other mirrors pretty much anywhere in
the kingdom).
Magic Mirror:
Some citizens, including the Muffin Man and one of the dwarves, who was
digging in a trash barrell for scraps, turned their attention to the mirror
in the shop.
Magic Mirror:
dictator!
The mirror's face disappeared and then there stood Rumpelstiltskin, in
another powdered wig, in front of a beachside sunset background.
Rumpelstiltskin:
curtsey) It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...shepherd of your dreams.
We then see him in a fake fern field, helping a little bird (which was also
fake, obviously) fly away. When watching this, one citizen coughed. Next,
Rumpelstiltskin slid backwards down a rainbow while on his back.
Rumpelstiltskin:
joyous lives.
The scenery changed to a fiery background.
Rumpelstiltskin:
ogre called Shrek!

Page 67/82

On mentioning the name, a picture of Shrek with Donkey appeared right next
to him. Then, the scene changed to a scenery of angels behind him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
citizens. For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a
lifetime.
He waved his hands, and a contract labeled "Deal of a Lifetime" appeared in
front of him. Then, as "Orinoco Flow" by Enya played in the background,
Rumpelstiltskin appeared on top of a mountain.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Since this message appeared on all magic mirrors, it even appeared on a
mirror that the three pigs, with the potty box, broom, and soap tub, were
nearby, happened to see this as well. Even the Wolf, pushing the wig cart,
saw this. The four were more than interested in getting the deal and not
having to put up with Rumpelstiltskin anymore.
Heimlich:
We now see the dictator's head spinning with gold coins raining in the
background.
Rumpelstiltskin:
wishes.
Gingy and his animal crackers saw this on the mirror, and the gingerbread
man was interested as well.
Gingy:
The deal maker appeared, sitting on a goose's back, next to a beachside.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Next, he was in front of a painting of his castle with fireworks shooting.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Pinocchio, who was tangled upside-down in ropes and sleeping, heard this
commercial and was interested as well.
Pinocchio:
Then, the dictator appeared next to a big hourglass.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The final scenery we see is Rumpelstiltskin's angry face in front of a
painting of a burning city.
Rumpelstiltskin:

Page 68/82

get your mob on!
The message got through to all citizens of Far Far Away as they all got
their pitchforks and torches and began storming through the kingdom to hunt
down Shrek, capture him and get their reward.
Mob:
Mob Member:
The mob passed a brick wall. If they had stayed a little longer, they would
have seen Shrek, Donkey, and Puss come out of hiding.
Puss:
Donkey:
Let's go.
Shrek:
Donkey:
now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you'll see.
The ogre slapped his forehead.
Donkey:
He couldn't hold it in any longer, so he finally started to shout.
Shrek:
after that, and there's no day after THAT day after that! My life was
perfect and I'm never going to get it back!
Donkey:
Rumpelstiltskin?
Shrek:
right?
He sighed sadly.
Shrek:
He looked like he was about to cry, but then he felt something and heard
tiny shouting. He looked down and saw Gingy hitting and attacking his feet
with his lollipop.
Gingy:
Of course, Shrek was not affected by this at all. He just stood there with
a dry look as Gingy kept attacking and shouting.

Page 69/82

Gingy:
Shrek:
He picked the gingerbread man up.
Gingy:
Shrek:
Gingy:
Puss:
Donkey:
Gingy:
could bring you in.
Shrek:
Gingy:
The ogre pondered this for a bit.
Shrek:
Donkey:
He then set Gingy down.
Shrek:
wants. (turns to Gingy) OK, Gingy, tell me about this...
But to his surprise, there were only crumbs and a gumdrop button on the
ground. He looked and saw Puss eating something, and it was apparently
Gingy. The cat noticed the ogre looking at him, and gave a sheepish look.
Puss:
Inside the castle, the citizens came with prisoners of theirs, and none of
them were Shrek, as the dictator pointed out while pacing and inspecting
each one. One citizen even brought in a bag of flour with a scary green
face painted on it.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He then saw Butter Pants and his father with a big green creature they
captured.

Page 70/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
(sees next one) And that...
What he saw was Wolf wearing a Shrek head over his own, claiming to be
captured by the pigs.
Wolf:
Rumpelstiltskin:
He then spotted Pinocchio with his father, dressed in Shrek's clothes and
fake ogre ears, with his face painted green and hands tied by a rope that
the puppet was holding.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Gepetto:
Pinocchio:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Pinocchio:
Then his nose grew and hit Rumpelstiltskin in the face, making the deal
maker shout in pain as he swatted it out of his face.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The frustrated villain then went to his table.
Rumpelstiltskin:
can it be?!
He angrily pounded on his table like a two-year-old.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Then the door of the throne room slammed open, and the ogre he wants is
there.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin jumped up and looked back, seeing Shrek wander through the
aisles.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Who turned him in? Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

Page 71/82

Shrek:
He took the 'deal of a lifetime' contract out of Rumpelstiltskin's hand.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Shrek:
He plucked a feather from Fifi and dipped in the magic ink jar.
Shrek:
The scared villain leaped onto the table, stopping him signing it.
Rumpelstiltskin:
contract! So if you thought you were just gonna (mimicks walking)
doot-doot-doot in here and get your life back--
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Outside the castle, Donkey and Puss awaited before all ogres of the
resistance magically appeared, one by one, an dropped from the sky. Donkey
saw Gretched falling towards where Puss was, so he used his teeth to pull
the cat out of the way.
Puss:
Of course, Donkey noticed that not ALL of them were free.
Donkey:
They all went up to the gates, knowing Shrek was still inside.
Puss:
Back in the throne room, the villagers have left, and Rumpelstiltskin was
leading Shrek, who had his hands shackled, to a dungeon room, with four
witches encircling the prisoner and pointing their brooms at him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
(mockingly) The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy
ogres.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
that, but, hey, I guess you can tell her yourself.
He and the cackling witches turned to reveal Fiona, shackled as well,

Page 72/82

struggling to get out.
Shrek:
Both ogres rushed to each other, but the weight of the shackles and chains
held them back. They tried breaking free from them to no avail, and
Rumpelstiltskin only cackled maniacally as he watched the two ogres
struggle to reach each other in failed attempts to his pure wicked
amusement.
Shrek:
Rumpelstiltskin:
all ogre, is she?
He gave a smug, evil smirk. Shrek's face faltered as he looked over at
Fiona worryingly.
Rumpelstiltskin:
blar. Ha ha!
He skipped merrily out of the room in triumph.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He and the laughing witches left the room, closing the doors and leaving
the two prisoners alone. Shrek gave a solemn sad look.
Fiona:
Shrek:
the Dragon's Keep, but...every day since.
Fiona:
Outside, Donkey was determined to get inside, but Gretched held him back by
the tail.
Donkey:
Gretched:
Brogan:
Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
Cookie:
ugly, nasty witches.
Of course, two witches guarding the palace from above, heard them.

Page 73/82

Palace Witch #1:
Brogan:
Then the ogres, Donkey and Puss huddled.
Puss:
Donkey:
Brogan:
Donkey then saw a shield, and it gave him an idea.
Donkey:
The group huddled in closer together, with the two palace guard witches
curious, wondering what they're talking about. A while later,
Rumpelstiltskin, with his speech wig back on for some reason (though it
looked untidy), walked back in the throne room, as a witch was hoisting up
what appeared to be a new big decorative ball like the one from earlier.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He noticed that something about this ball was different than the previous
one.
Rumpelstiltskin:
it'll have to do.
Once the witches got it up, some other witches poured magic glowing dust in
their cauldrons, causing bright, glowing, blue and pink lights to appear.
They pointed their cauldrons like spotlights at the big ball, which began
reflecting the bright colorful lights off like a disco ball.
Rumpelstiltskin:
for. The main event of the evening!
The floors under him began shifting, revealing something. It was Shrek and
Fiona still bound in shackles and chained to the walls, with a spotlight
shining down on them.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The prisoners looked up, both glaring at Rumpelstiltskin and the horde of
witches up above peering down at them, and the witches all booed and jeered
the ogres.
Rumpelstiltskin:
all, I give ya a princess's worst nightmare! Fiona's old flame, the keeper
of the keep...

Page 74/82

As he continued speaking, Shrek and Fiona saw a gate in the dungeon opening
up and a familiar red dragon stormed in.
Rumpelstiltskin:
She let out a huge roar and then started breathing fire. She stomped about,
getting ready to finish her prisoners as Rumpelstiltskin laughed
heartlessly, enjoying the ogres' soon-to-be demise. Then suddenly he and
the witches heard a familiar voice singing from out of nowhere.
Donkey's Voice:
They all gasped, looking up at the big ball, seeing Donkey at the top of
it, singing.
Donkey:
yeah, yeah
Dragon, who was nearing Shrek, turned her attention up to the ball.
Shrek:
Donkey:
On cue, though very slowly, Puss slid down the rope holding the ball, and
this time, he was wearing his hat, cape and boots.
Puss:
He tap danced a bit on top of the ball, and then from inside it, a humming
noise was heard, to the witches' and Rumpelstiltskin's concern.
Rumpelstiltskin:
They all looked around to see where the noise was coming from, and the new
ball suddenly broke open like a pinata and all the resistance ogres began
flying out of it, yelling. The whole thing turned out to be a Trojan horse
reenactment with the ogres using their shields to make it convincing. All
the witches screamed as the ogres chased after them with their clubs and
weapons, ready to clobber them. Brogan leaped out towards where
Rumpelstiltskin was, making the dictator scream as he ran for it. Brogan
rose his club, ready to strike the villain, but one of the witches flew by
on her broomstick, scooping up her master and taking him to the higher
balcony, dropping him there. Rumpelstiltskin jumped onto the railing and
looked down at the chaos in horror. Puss and Donkey meanwhile saw Dragon
returning her attention to the ogres, snarling like mad and ready to attack
again, but Puss then cut the rope of the platform he and Donkey were on,
sending them falling and screaming, but they landed on Dragon's head,
knocking her down for the count. Rumpelstiltskin, still watching, grumbled
and growled.

Page 75/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
So the witches on the balcony got out their pumpkin bombs and chucked them
down to where all the resistance ogres were. They luckily saw the pumpkins
about to be thrown.
Ogre:
They all took their shields and blocked themselves with them, with the
exploding pumpkins bouncing off and not blowing up one single ogre. The
woozy Donkey got up on his legs.
Shrek:
Donkey:
Shrek:
Speaking of whom, Dragon growled as she stomped behind the fear-stricken
Donkey. He timidly turned, screaming a bit. Then suddenly the lights
changed to blue as Donkey's fearful expression changed to a smooth charmer
expression, with the donkey trying his best to woo the reptile, who's look
of anger began to fade, as if the charm was working. Donkey then gave a
grin, and Dragon batted her eyelashes lovingly. At this time, a certain
Lionel Richie song played.
Hello Is it me you're looking for I can see it in your eyes
The two were about to kiss until Dragon's mouth opened wide around Donkey.
Donkey:
Then in one chomp, Donkey ended up in her mouth. Puss then leaped onto the
dragon's spine, grabbed his sword and jabbed it right into the back, making
the dragon roar and spit out Donkey, who was sent flying in the air.
Donkey:
He hitched a ride onto a passing witch's broomstick.
Donkey:
love!
Witch:
Back below, the dragon spotted the fat cat and just as she tried to eat
him, he leaped out of the way, shouting in excitement. He rode her tail,
which she swished around like mad, hitting a wall where Shrek was, and the
ogre ducked in time. Then Dragon flicked the screeching fat cat off her
tail, and Fiona caught him in her arms. Fiona gasped, knowing Dragon was
coming for them, so she turned away, getting ready for the blow and Dragon

Page 76/82

exhaled the biggest breath of flame from her mouth. After she breathed it,
she then saw that Fiona and Puss were no longer there, then she spotted the
ogre being lifted up by the chains, thanks to Shrek pulling on the chains
with his wrists, and Puss was holding onto Fiona's back.
Shrek:
He then got Dragon chasing after him as he continued pulling on the chains.
Shrek:
Then Shrek and Fiona ended up swinging around on both chains all around the
room, and each time they got near Dragon's mouth, she tried to eat them,
only to miss. Then both ogres each reached a dangling cage. Shrek reached
out his hand, and Fiona swung a bit, taking his hand. Back above, witches
kept launching skull chains at the ogres, pulling them up, though no matter
how many skull chains ensnared Brogan, he did his best to resist. He even
grabbed some of the chains and tossed some of the witches who had them
down. Then, on the balcony, the short villain saw chimichangas being fired
at some of the witches near him.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Down below, Cookie was launching the aforementioned sticky foods from his
cart/catapult.
Cookie:
He even launched one at the witch that Donkey was riding with. When the
witch was knocked down by the snack, Donkey was impressed. Below in the
dungeon, Shrek and Fiona made it the top of the middle dangling cage. They
looked down, waiting for Dragon to leap out at them, and when she did, that
was their chance.
Fiona:
They both leaped onto the separate cages, while Dragon got her snout stuck
in the middle cage. They looked at each other while holding their chains.
Shrek:
They both leaped off the cages, and started swinging around Dragon like
acrobats.
Fiona:
As Dragon kept struggling to get the cage off her muzzle, the two ogres
began wrapping the chains around the reptile, starting with her tail.
Shrek:

Page 77/82

Fiona:
Shrek:
They then both reached the center of the dragon's back, finishing trussing
her in chains.
Both:
They both tugged on the chains, and Dragon, bound in them, was sent
tumbling down. Then Shrek and Fiona looked at the battle still going on
above. The witches were screaming as the ogres were getting the better of
them.
Palace Witch:
Some witches ran and flew off on their brooms, screaming. On the balcony,
Rumpelstiltskin saw that ogres were closing in on both sides where he was,
giving him nowhere to run. He then made for the balcony's railing as the
ogres had him cornered. He turned back towards them.
Rumpelstiltskin:
With that, he leaped off backwards, to the ogres' shock. Then they were
surprised further to see the short foe riding on Fifi, who was flying
upwards so they could make their escape.
Rumpelstiltskin:
He laughed tauntingly as Fifi headed for the skylight, as dawn was
approaching, but then a skull chain had snagged Fifi's leg, and Shrek was
the one who was holding the chain.
Shrek:
Fiona and Shrek grabbed hold of each other.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Fifi tried to keep flying, pulling Shrek and Fiona out of the dungeon.
Rumpelstiltskin:
The floor began closing up, but Shrek and Fiona were pulled out just in
time. Fifi tried to keep flying even though it was harder with the chain
around her leg.
Rumpelstiltskin:
on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!
The smirking Shrek pulled the chain, causing Rumpelstiltskin to loose his
grip on his goose, as he was sent falling and screaming.

Page 78/82

Rumpelstiltskin:
His fall was stopped when a glaring Fiona caught him, making him give a
scared sound. Fiona then held up the short man like a trophy.
Fiona:
All the ogres shouted and cheered in triumph, while raising their weapons.
Donkey then started tapping his hooves with Puss doing a little victory tap
dance, until at the end when the top of his boots began to split, to the
fat cat's embarassment. Cookie then carried off the worried and defeated
villain in his arm, as he and Brogan gave smirks towards him.
Brogan:
When all was settled, Fiona and Shrek looked to each other.
Fiona:
Shrek:
The two then looked at each other, staying silent for a moment, but then
Shrek noticed something serious. His hand was started to give a bright
yellow glow, making him gasp. He saw that morning was starting to happen,
so that meant he was beginning to fade away. His legs also started glowing
as he fell down.
Fiona:
She held him up. They saw the magic hourglass of Shrek's life was almost
out of sand, to Rumpelstiltskin's delight.
Rumpelstiltskin:
But Cookie squeezed him, making the villain gag.
Fiona:
Shrek:
The ogres, Donkey and Puss watched on sadly.
Fiona:
Shrek:
home and a family.
Fiona:
Shrek:

Page 79/82

Both:
Fiona:
Shrek:
The fading ogre then dug in his pocket and pulled out the squeaky toy
belonging to their daughter.
Shrek:
He handed it to her, and she looked at it sadly, before looking back
towards him.
Shrek:
fall in love with you all over again.
Tears began to form from Fiona's eyes as she leaned her head towards
Shrek's face. The hour glass emptied and the light began to glow brightly
all around Shrek's body as Fiona kissed him deeply, and then Shrek began to
fade away into nothing but sparkles of golden dust that also began to fade
away as Fiona held him. It seemed Shrek was no more. Then the sun rising
behind Fiona began to shine brightly, illuminating the whole room as she
sat there on her knees with tears running down her face, which was still
green, to Puss's notice.
Puss:
Fiona:
Rumpelstiltskin:
Fiona:
Suddenly the wind began blasting and brushing by everyone, also knocking
Puss's hat off his head. Everyone looked up and saw the magic golden light
that brought Shrek here begin to eat away at Rumpelstiltskin's castle like
mad. All bricks, shingles and other material of the castle were sucked away
in a magical tornado.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Then, one by one, each witch and ogre began to puff away into puffs of
yellow smoke. Cookie and Brogan quickly vanished, dropping Rumpelstiltskin,
and he then saw Fifi vanish in a puff of smoke as well.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Then Donkey and Puss were the next to vanish.

Page 80/82

Fiona:
Then Fiona vanished next. The horrified Rumpelstiltskin, the only one
remaining, twisted in circles in place while shouting in alarm as his whole
world around him was tearing away and disappearing.
Rumpelstiltskin:
Then the floor under him, the only thing remaining, crackled away and he
began falling down into an abyss of pure golden light while screaming out
loud in horror, before everything went black for him.
The world changed back to a different world where Shrek was giving his big,
loud ogre roar from before.
Shrek:
RRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!!
Once he was done, he panted and saw where he was. He was back in his own
original world and at his kids' birthday party, as if he never left it. It
was as if the magic of true love's kiss reversed everything to the event
where he roared. He saw that everyone else in the Candy Apple was left
stunned and silent for a bit until they all cheered.
Butterpants:
As everyone began chanting Shrek's name, the ogre began to smile, happy to
have his life back, and everyone he knew back to normal.
Everyone:
Gingy saw one of the Three Blind Mice facing the other way so he turned the
mouse around correctly.
Wolf then slapped a party hat onto Shrek's head.
Puss:
He lifted his cape to reveal another cake decorated like the last one.
Puss:
Fiona:
He turned to see Fiona, the way she was before signing his life away. He
removed the party hat and went up to hug his wife.
Shrek:
Fiona smiled warmly, and the parents then heard their kids playfully
roaring.
Fergus:
All triplets began roaring and giggling. Shrek was even happy to see his

Page 81/82

kids existing as he went to them.
Shrek:
little man! And Felicia, sweetheart.
His baby daughter looked at him with big, happy, blue eyes. He then reached
his pocket and handed her the squeaky ogre plush toy he magically came back
into this world with.
Shrek:
She hugged the toy tightly.
Felicia:
Shrek:
Donkey:
Puss:
The others insisted eagerly. However, instead of a roar, Shrek held his
nose and blew a toot threw his ears. Then, all three of his babies held
their noses and blew smaller toots through their ears. As their friends
applauded and Puss waved a little yellow flag, Fiona was astounded.
Fiona:
Donkey:
Shrek then looked towards Fiona.
Shrek:
Dragon's Keep.
Fiona:
Shrek:
The two smiled warmly before kissing with their babies hugging them, while
everyone cheered. Then, the scene changed to a picture of the still scene
in the final page of a book Shrek had out.
"The End"
